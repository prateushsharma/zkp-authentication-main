# ZKP gRPC Client/Server for Authentication

This project implements a gRPC server and client leveraging the Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) Rust library for secure authentication. The integration of ZKP with gRPC ensures that users can be authenticated without revealing sensitive information, enhancing privacy and security. gRPC, a high-performance, universal RPC framework, is employed to handle the communication between the client and server.
